# Smart Handoffs

**Note**: This feature relies on the [Common Metadata Repository (CMR)](https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/) and does not work for data sets stored elsewhere.

This feature also relies on visualization metadata served by [GIBS](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/eosdis/science-system-description/eosdis-components/gibs) in order to map a layer in Worldview to the right data collections in CMR.
